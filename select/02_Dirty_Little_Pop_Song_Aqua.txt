DJ, DJ on the floor
Who's your slutty little whore
My DJ, D-D-D-DJ
Press the button, turn it up
Boost it till it makes you hot
My DJ, D-D-D-DJ

I wanna buy what you're selling so let's cut to the chase
You're a mind fucker, baby, and your pimp is the bass
The beat is on nonstop, it's the pulse of the night
And it draws you in like a red street light
And it draws you in like a red street light

I'm just a dirty little pop song
That keeps running through your brain
And even though you know it's so wrong
You're gonna love going insane
I'm just a dirty little pop song
That keeps running through your brain
And even though you know it's so wrong
You're gonna love going insane, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh

I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh
I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa

Kill me slowly, do it right
When you're on the floor tonight
Da-dancing, da-da-da-dancing
Wind me up and break me down
Twist me, turn me 'round and 'round
D-D-D-D-DJ

The first hit is on me
So, baby, set yourself free
'Cause you can't let me go
I'm on your radio
This is a fight you can't win
Because I'm already in
And though I blow your mind
You'll wanna re-rewind
And though I blow your mind
You wanna re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-rewind

I'm just a dirty little pop song
That keeps running through your brain
And even though you know it's so wrong
You're gonna love going insane
I'm just a dirty little pop song
That keeps running through your brain
And even though you know it's so wrong
You're gonna love going insane, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh

I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh
I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh

On the radio, on your stereo
In the video, on the disco
On the radio, on your stereo
In the video, on the disco

I'm just a dirty little pop song
That keeps running through your brain
And even though you know it's so wrong
You're gonna love going insane, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh

I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh
I'm spinning in your head
Spinning in your head
Spinning in your head, ooh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh
