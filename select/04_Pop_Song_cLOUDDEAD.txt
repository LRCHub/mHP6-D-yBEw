Two, three
I can't do it without
Go!

(It's) the wooden woman and her hollowing out

(It's) the wooden woman and her hollowing out (Skinny Minnie Mouse!)

Elvis, what happened?
Elvis, what happened?

Pop
Popsicle
No
The label stapled a speaker
To the back of a sheep's throat
Tongue depressor with the width
The width of a spatula
Suppresses all (sylla-)

Oh?
"Bah bah blah"
"Bah bah blah"
"Bah bah blah"
End, end, end quote

High (high), school (school) picture
Day in L.A
Someone in the sky (with diamonds, with diamonds)
(And you go back) And you go back to bed
With a dead dog (if I dare) in your hand
Two perfect strangers (strangers) carrying a ladder (carrying a ladder)
You can tell they're strangers
Chasing themselves in the windows of shops

How can I be your lover?
When you sport a head of rubber?
Sucker
You can't (can't) take (can't) applause to bed (with you)
I've got my own blood
And a decent depression of the mind

And then we said
Fuck
In our pop song
In our pop song

Hi kiddies
Well
We're cramping and sweating and groaning with the rest of them
(Is that all?)

Well, I'll try and give you that dope that you were talking about
We've already wrecked about three records trying to perfect one
First, sounded like we were talking in a thrashing machine
And then, one thing or another
So maybe this thing isn't gonna turn out alright
These records are sure the real McCoy
Your voices sounded so real on the last one
I almost caught myself answering back a couple of times

Well I'll see ya soon
And, send another record if you have one
Being here is sure swell
We're gonna be on our vacation in

Hello? Who is this?
Huh?
